ChatGPT CloneThis project is a simplified clone of ChatGPT, comprising both a React frontend and a FastAPI backend. It features user authentication, real-time chat interactions with an AI model (Ollama), and persistent chat history.‚ú® FeaturesUser Authentication: Securely sign up and log in to access your chat history.Real-time Chat: Send messages and receive AI-generated responses from a local Ollama model.Chat History: View and manage your past conversations, persisted in a SQLite database.Dynamic Chat Titles: Chat titles in the sidebar are automatically generated from the first few words of your initial question.Sidebar Navigation: Easily switch between existing chats or start a new conversation.Chat Management:Create new chat sessions.Delete individual chat conversations.Delete all chat history.Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern and adaptive user interface.Loading Indicators: Visual feedback when messages are being sent or responses are being generated.Auto-Scrolling: Chat view automatically scrolls to the latest message.üöÄ Technologies UsedFrontendReact: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.Redux Toolkit: The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.TypeScript: For type-safe JavaScript development.BackendFastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.SQLAlchemy: The Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.SQLite: A lightweight, file-based SQL database used for data persistence.passlib: For secure password hashing (bcrypt).langchain-community: Used for managing chat message history.langchain-ollama: Integrates with Ollama for local AI model inference.uvicorn: An ASGI web server for running FastAPI applications.‚öôÔ∏è PrerequisitesBefore you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:Node.js (LTS version recommended) & npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn (for the frontend).Python 3.8+ & pip (Python package installer) (for the backend).Ollama: Install Ollama and pull the gemma2:2b model.ollama run gemma2:2b
üì¶ InstallationFrontend SetupClone the repository (or set up your project files):git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-directory>/frontend # Assuming your frontend code is in a 'frontend' subfolder
(Replace <your-repository-url> and <your-project-directory> with your actual project details. Adjust cd command if your project structure is different.)Install frontend dependencies:npm install
# or
yarn install
Backend SetupNavigate to the backend directory:cd <your-project-directory>/backend # Assuming your backend code is in a 'backend' subfolder
(Adjust cd command if your project structure is different.)Create a Python virtual environment (recommended):python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Linux/macOS
# .\venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows
Install backend dependencies:pip install "fastapi[all]" sqlalchemy passlib "langchain-community" "langchain-ollama"
(Note: fastapi[all] includes uvicorn and pydantic dependencies)‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the ApplicationTo run the full application, you need to start both the backend and the frontend servers.1. Start the Backend ServerEnsure Ollama is running and the gemma2:2b model is downloaded.Navigate to your backend directory (if you're not already there).Activate your virtual environment (if you created one).Run the FastAPI application:uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
The backend server will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000.2. Start the Frontend ApplicationNavigate to your frontend directory (if you're not already there).Start the React development server:npm start
# or
yarn start
The application will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or another available port).üöÄ UsageSign Up / Log In:Upon launching the application, you'll be presented with a login or signup form.If you're a new user, click "Sign up" and create your account.If you already have an account, log in with your credentials.Start Chatting:After logging in, you'll see the main chat interface.Type your message in the input box at the bottom and press Enter or click "Send".The AI's response will appear in the chat window.Manage Chats:The sidebar on the left displays your chat history.Click on a chat title to load that conversation.Click "+ New Chat" to start a fresh conversation.Use the "X" icon next to a chat title to delete an individual chat.Click "Delete All Chats" to clear your entire chat history.Toggle Sidebar:Click the menu icon in the top-left corner of the sidebar to collapse or expand it.
